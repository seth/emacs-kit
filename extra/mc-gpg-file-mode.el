;; Abstract:
;; 
;; This mode helps you to handle gpg encrypted files in emacs
;; comfortably. This can be useful to store secrets (passwords etc.)
;; When you open a file with ending 'gpg' it gets decrypted and
;; displayed in emacs and it gets encrypted just before you save
;; it. Similar to auto-compression-mode for '.gz' files just that you
;; need your pass-phrase for decryption.

;; How to use this:
;; 
;; * make sure that mailcrypt is installed and functional
;;
;; * Put this file in a place where emacs can find it. e.g. put this
;;   in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/sw/share/emacs/site-lisp") load-path)) 
;;
;;   and put this file in the directory ~/sw/share/emacs/site-lisp
;;
;; * Put this in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'mailcrypt)
;;   (mc-setversion "gpg")
;;   (require 'mc-gpg-file-mode)
;;
;; * Optionally put something like this in your .emacs if your gpg
;;   user id does not match your account name or such
;;
;;   (setq mc-gpg-user-id "josef.bauer.nospam@web.de")
;;
;; * Just open a gpg encrypted file in emacs and 'hope' that it gets
;;   decrypted after loading

;; Dependencies:
;;
;; mailcrypt as found at http://mailcrypt.sourceforge.net. This
;; version of mc-gpg-file-mode should work with mailcrypt version
;; 3.5.8.

;; Compatability:
;;
;; This version of mc-gpg-file-mode was tested with (GNU) emacs
;; 21.3.1, gpg 1.2.4 and mailcrypt 3.5.8 on linux 2.6 (SuSE 9.1).

;; History:
;;
;; For a long time I used an encrypted file for passwords and such
;; that I manually en- and decrypted using mailcrypt in emacs. Then I
;; started to write a generic mode that decrypted the buffer after
;; loading. When I found mc-auto-encrypt.el I extended my mode to
;; automatically encrypt the file before writing.
